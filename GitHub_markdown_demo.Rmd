```{r}
duration = faithful$eruptions      # the eruption durations 
waiting = faithful$waiting         # the waiting interval 
head(cbind(duration, waiting)) 

duration = faithful$eruptions      # the eruption durations 
waiting = faithful$waiting         # the waiting interval 
plot(duration, waiting,            # plot the variables 
  xlab="Eruption duration",        # x−axis label 
  ylab="Time waited")              # y−axis label

abline(lm(waiting ~ duration))     # add a line to show lm fitting result
